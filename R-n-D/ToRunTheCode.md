Absolutely ‚Äî let's break this down properly.

You're building an **interview environment where users can write code, execute it, and get feedback**. For that, you need a **language runner** ‚Äî a service that can **securely compile/interpret and run code** in different languages and return the result.

---

## üöÄ What Are Language Runners?

A **language runner** is a component (or service) that:

1. Receives code + input
2. Executes the code in a safe, isolated environment (like Docker)
3. Captures stdout, stderr, exit status, and execution time
4. Returns the results to your app for evaluation

## üîß Two Main Approaches

### ü•á **1. Judge0 API (Best for MVP / hosted solution)**

**Judge0** is a ready-made, open-source API that supports 50+ languages.

#### ‚úÖ Pros:

- Hosted solution available (or self-host)
- Simple REST API
- Multi-language support (Python, C++, Java, JS, etc.)
- Input/output support
- Status tracking (e.g., compilation error, runtime error)
- Usage limits (free up to some quota)

#### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works:

You make a POST request to Judge0 with:

```json
{
  "language_id": 63, // e.g., for JavaScript
  "source_code": "console.log(1+1);",
  "stdin": "",
  "expected_output": "2"
}
```

Then poll for the result.

#### üîó Docs:

[https://judge0.com/docs](https://judge0.com/docs)

#### üöÄ Usage in Code (simplified):

```ts
// JavaScript example using axios
const response = await axios.post("https://api.judge0.com/submissions", {
  source_code: "console.log(1+1)",
  language_id: 63,
  stdin: "",
  expected_output: "2",
  wait: true,
});
console.log(response.data.stdout); // "2"
```

> ‚úÖ **Best choice for your use case if you want to go fast and support many languages.**

### üß± **2. Dockerized Language Runners (Best for custom / production / offline use)**

This approach involves **spinning up Docker containers** on your own server, running code inside them, and returning the results.

#### ‚úÖ Pros:

- Total control (no API limits or external dependency)
- Safer long-term for production and scaling
- Better security practices (can sandbox with memory, CPU, time limits)

#### ‚ùå Cons:

- More complex setup (DevOps, container orchestration)
- Harder to support many languages
- Needs container management (timeouts, logs, etc.)

#### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works:

1. You write Docker images for each language (or use existing ones).
2. Your backend spins up a container per execution (e.g., with Dockerode, shell scripts, or a queuing system).
3. Mount user code, run it, capture output.

#### Example:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/code:/code python:3.11 python /code/solution.py
```

> You can use libraries like `Dockerode` (Node.js), or run via `child_process` if it's on the same host.

#### Good Base Images:

- Python: `python:<version>`
- Node: `node:<version>`
- C++: `gcc:<version>`
- Java: `openjdk:<version>`

## üîê Security Considerations (for both approaches)

When users can run arbitrary code, **sandboxing is critical**.

### Judge0:

- Already sandboxed (uses seccomp, cgroups, etc.)
- You can self-host if you want more control

### Dockerized:

- Always run untrusted code in isolated containers
- Apply:
  - CPU + memory limits (`--memory=128m --cpus=0.5`)
  - Timeouts (kill container after N seconds)
  - No network access
  - Mount a temp folder for code (no volume reuse)

## üÜö Judge0 vs Docker Runners

| Feature                 | Judge0 API            | Docker Runners (Custom)      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Setup time              | ‚úÖ Minimal            | ‚ùå High                      |
| Custom language configs | ‚ùå Limited            | ‚úÖ Fully customizable        |
| Security                | ‚úÖ Good (sandboxed)   | ‚úÖ If implemented properly   |
| Scaling                 | ‚úÖ With API Plan      | ‚úÖ With Docker orchestration |
| Best for                | MVP, Hackathons, SaaS | Production, Full control     |

## ‚úÖ My Recommendation for You

| Situation                                    | Use                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Want to ship fast, support 10+ languages     | **Use Judge0 (hosted or self-hosted)**                               |
| Want full control, private env, custom rules | **Docker-based runners**                                             |
| Long-term serious product                    | Start with **Judge0**, migrate to **Docker runners** later if needed |

---

## üß™ Bonus: Hybrid Setup

You can even start with **Judge0**, and for a few selected languages (e.g., Python, JS) use **your own runners** later with better customization and performance.
