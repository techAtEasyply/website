Absolutely! Based on your screenshot and your comments, you want to build an **online technical interview platform** with the following features:

- **Live video (AI interviewer + candidate)**
- **Coding problem panel (with code editor, language selection, and code execution)**
- **Test cases and output validation**
- **LLM (AI) can see and evaluate the code and output**
- **Real-time feedback and scoring**

Here’s a **high-level design** and a roadmap for technologies, features, and what you’ll need to learn:

---

## 1. **Frontend (UI/UX)**

**Tech Stack:**
- **React** (already using)
- **Monaco Editor** or **CodeMirror** (for in-browser code editing, like VSCode)
- **Socket.IO** or **WebRTC** (for real-time video and chat)
- **Tailwind CSS** or **Chakra UI** (for styling)
- **Axios/Fetch** (for API calls)

**Features to Implement:**
- Code editor with syntax highlighting, language selection, and code execution button
- Video call panel (WebRTC or third-party like Daily.co, Twilio, or Agora)
- Test case display and result panel
- Real-time updates (Socket.IO for chat, code sync, etc.)
- Timer, question navigation, and progress bar

**Things to Learn:**
- How to integrate Monaco/CodeMirror in React
- How to use WebRTC or a video API for live video
- How to use Socket.IO for real-time features

---

## 2. **Backend (API & Code Execution)**

**Tech Stack:**
- **Node.js/Express** (already using)
- **Socket.IO** (for real-time communication)
- **Prisma/PostgreSQL** (already using, for storing questions, user data, results)
- **Docker** (for secure code execution in isolated containers)
- **LLM Integration** (OpenAI, local LLM, or similar for AI interviewer and code review)

**Features to Implement:**
- API endpoints for fetching questions, submitting code, getting results
- Secure code execution service (run user code in Docker containers for each language)
- Real-time communication endpoints (for chat, code sync, etc.)
- LLM integration for AI interviewer, code review, and feedback

**Things to Learn:**
- How to run untrusted code securely (Docker, sandboxing, or use a service like [Judge0](https://judge0.com/))
- How to integrate LLMs (OpenAI API, local models, etc.)
- How to design RESTful or GraphQL APIs

---

## 3. **Code Execution Service**

**Options:**
- **Self-hosted:** Use Docker to spin up containers for each code run (most flexible, but complex and needs security)
- **Third-party API:** Use [Judge0](https://judge0.com/), [Sphere Engine](https://sphere-engine.com/), or [Piston](https://github.com/engineer-man/piston) for code execution

**Things to Learn:**
- How to use Docker programmatically
- How to call third-party code execution APIs
- How to handle timeouts, infinite loops, and resource limits

---

## 4. **LLM/AI Integration**

**Tech Stack:**
- **OpenAI API** (or similar) for code review, feedback, and AI interviewer
- **LangChain** (optional, for orchestrating LLM workflows)

**Features to Implement:**
- Send code and output to LLM for review
- Generate feedback, hints, and scores
- Simulate AI interviewer (ask follow-up questions, evaluate answers)

**Things to Learn:**
- How to call LLM APIs from your backend
- How to structure prompts for code review and feedback

---

## 5. **Authentication & User Management**

**Tech Stack:**
- **Clerk** (already integrated)
- **JWT/OAuth** (if you want to expand auth options)

---

## 6. **Other Features**

- **Recording and playback** (for interviews)
- **Admin panel** (to add/edit questions)
- **Analytics and reporting**

---

## **To-Do List / Roadmap**

1. Integrate Monaco/CodeMirror for code editing
2. Add language selection and code execution button
3. Set up backend API for code execution (use Judge0 or Docker)
4. Display test cases and show output/results
5. Integrate LLM for code review and feedback
6. Add video call (WebRTC or third-party)
7. Implement real-time features (Socket.IO)
8. Polish UI/UX (styling, error handling, etc.)
9. Add authentication and user management
10. Add admin features, analytics, and recording (optional)

## **What to Learn/Research**

- Monaco Editor/CodeMirror integration in React
- Secure code execution (Judge0, Docker, Piston)
- WebRTC basics or third-party video APIs
- Socket.IO for real-time features
- OpenAI API or other LLMs for code review
- REST API design and security
