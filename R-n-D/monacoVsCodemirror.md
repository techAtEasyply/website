### üîç _Monaco Editor vs CodeMirror ‚Äì Recommendation_

Both _Monaco_ and _CodeMirror_ are powerful, but here‚Äôs a clear comparison with a recommendation tailored to your use case:

| Feature                     | _Monaco Editor_ (used in VSCode)              | _CodeMirror_                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Language support            | Excellent (via built-in LSPs and web workers) | Very good (limited compared to Monaco) |
| IntelliSense / autocomplete | ‚úÖ Native support                             | ‚ùå Basic (requires plugins)            |
| Look & feel                 | Closest to VSCode                             | Simpler                                |
| Performance                 | Heavier (more RAM, slower load)               | Lighter, faster                        |
| Customization               | High                                          | High                                   |
| Code execution integration  | Works well via messaging/events               | Works well                             |
| Size (bundle)               | \~3‚Äì5MB                                       | \~1‚Äì2MB                                |
| React support               | ‚úÖ via @monaco-editor/react                   | ‚úÖ via @uiw/react-codemirror           |
| Community/Docs              | Strong                                        | Strong                                 |
| Best suited for...          | Full coding interview IDE experience          | Lightweight embedded editors           |

### ‚úÖ _My Recommendation: Go with Monaco Editor_

You‚Äôre trying to build an _authentic interview experience_, and that means:

- Real VSCode-like experience
- Language-specific syntax + suggestions
- Realistic environment for coders

> So _Monaco Editor_ is the better fit. It's heavier, but it brings a professional, familiar developer feel that aligns with your vision.

### üîß Bonus Tips for Monaco Integration:

Use @monaco-editor/react:

bash
npm install @monaco-editor/react

Basic example:

tsx
import Editor from "@monaco-editor/react";

<Editor
height="500px"
defaultLanguage="javascript"
defaultValue="// type your code here"
onChange={(value) => {
// send to backend or evaluate
}}
/>

To run code, you can:

- Use sandboxed execution (like eval for JS)
- Use Docker/serverless backend for Python, C++, etc.

### ‚úÖ Suggested Architecture for You

- _Frontend (React + TS):_
  - Monaco Editor
  - Video (WebRTC / daily.js / livekit / Twilio)
  - Problem description + Test cases
  - Code submission UI

- _Backend:_
  - Language runners (Dockerized or using something like [Judge0 API](https://judge0.com/))
  - Prisma + PostgreSQL for storing sessions
  - OpenAI / LLM eval based on code + output

- _LLM Feedback:_
  - Send:
    - Code
    - Input
    - Output
    - Expected Output
    - Time taken, code quality

  - Ask model: ‚ÄúScore this solution, suggest improvements‚Äù

Let me know if you want help setting up:

- Monaco with real-time evaluation
- LLM scoring prompts
- Dockerized code execution securely for multiple languages

You're building something really cool. Let's make it interview-ready.
